Some math formulas that could be used in these problems include:
●Area of a rectangle:
A = l * w
●Area of a circle:
A = π * r^2
●Circumference of a circle:
C = 2 * π * r
●Pythagorean theorem:
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
●Volume of a sphere:
V = (4/3) * π * r^3
●Surface area of a sphere:
A = 4 * π * r^2
●Factorial:
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1
●Sum of an arithmetic series:
S = (n/2) * (a1 + an)
●Sum of a geometric series:
S = a1 * ((1 - r^n) / (1- r))
●Sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers:
S = (n * (n+1) * (2n+1)) / 6
●Sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers:
S= (n * (n+1) / 2)^2
●Quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
●Binomial coefficient:
C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)
●Fibonacci sequence:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
